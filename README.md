# NikitOS

**Build what you need, when you need it.**

Tired of juggling apps? NikitOS changes how you use your computer. Instead of being stuck with pre-built software, you just describe what you want to do. The system then generates a custom "panel"â€”anything from a simple tool to a complex appâ€”tailored to your task.

Itâ€™s a fluid, adaptive workspace that molds to you, not the other way around.

## How It Works

*   **Speak Your Mind:** Use plain English to describe the tool you need (e.g., "a simple pomodoro timer" or "a kanban board for my project").
*   **Instant Tools:** AI generates a custom interface (a "panel") on the fly. No more hunting for the right app.
*   **Always Improving:** The system learns from you. You can also ask the AI to tweak or add features to any panel you've made.
*   **Connected Workspace:** Your panels can work together, sharing information to create a seamless workflow.
